These are all the resources I referenced (even if only a little) in creating this app
I didn't take any code line-for-line from these, but they were more reference material when deciding the ways to go about things

Helped me learn content vs detail a bit better and handle navigating between sheets

Helped me learn how to open sheets before we covered it in class :)

*Helped me know how to implement the toolbars and section headers easily

Used this to remind me of the exact syntax of switch cases in Swift (ended up removing my switch case)

Used this to remind me of the exact syntax of sorting in Swift

You eventually showed us how to do this, but this helped remind me that I needed to be "saving" to SwiftData after every change to the model (after editing, adding, deleting a recipe, loading data, etc.)

I had this up ready to use, but you showed us how to use it
https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftdata/how-to-pre-populate-an-app-with-an-existing-swiftdata-database

Used the documentation to help me know how to set up the markdown for the pre-populated recipes
The thing it helped the most for was the "alternatingRows" code I have in RecipeView for the table header

Used this to quickly see how to create an AsyncImage

Didn't end up using this, but it was interesting
