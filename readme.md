Hey Professor Liddle!

Not much to say here! I put most of my thoughts in the rubric this time!

But I just wanted to say, I really enjoyed making this app! I thought it was a lot of fun and stretched me in just the right ways to help me grow while still being very achieveable! I thougth this was a really good balance!

Some extra things I did/added are:
- Images from URL's for recipes
- Searching on any text field in recipes (not just one)
- Nice styling / UI for quotes, tables, icons, etc.
